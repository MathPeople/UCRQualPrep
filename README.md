# About
This repository is for the GitHub Pages website "MathPeople." Its primary use is for hosting studying materials for graduate level mathematics at UCR. 


# Wiki
The [Wiki](https://github.com/MathPeople/MathPeople.github.io/wiki) is out of date and requires a rewrite. For now, please use the coding documentation in the javascript files and refer to any of the existing `content/(subject).md` for templating of a new subject page. 


# Maintainers
The website was created by Alec Martin and redesigned/restructured by Will Hoffer. The website is in need of new contributors and a new maintainer.
