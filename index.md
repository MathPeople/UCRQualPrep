### About
This website contains a collection of study materials for the graduate mathematics program at UCR. This is for the purposes of studying mathematics, and in particular studying to pass [written qualification exams](https://mathdept.ucr.edu/grads/apply/qualifying-exams) for the different core sequences. The subjects currently supported are listed in the navigation bar, and one can find lists of practice problems which can be searched by topic. Be sure to keep up-to-date with your class materials, more recent past quals, and the resources provided by the qual prep workshop instructors.

This website is run through the "MathPeople" Github account, made and maintained by University of California, Riverside mathematics graduate students. Check out the repository at <a href="https://github.com/MathPeople/MathPeople.github.io">https://github.com/MathPeople/MathPeople.github.io</a>.

### Instructions

##### Practice Tests

Practice tests can be automatically generated using a fixed template. To generate a new randomized test, click the "Make New Test" button.

These can be very useful, but note that these are limited to only problems available on the website and the layout of the exam is only a guess at what the actual qual might look like in a given year. For a best approximation of what the actual written exam will look like review recent past quals, final/midterm exams, and hand-made practice exams. This is especially true if a certain topic was covered more extensively or never covered at all in a given section.

##### Problem Sorting 
Problems can be sorted by topic. Expand the `Select Topics` field and select the checkboxes that correspond to the topics you wish to see. Then, click `Filter Problems` to show those which have been flagged with that topic. Use the `Display All` button to reset the display. 

### Contribute!
You can help make the website better! Type up problems/solutions in Latex and send these to the current maintainers of the website to get them implemented. If you notice an error in a problem or a solution (be it mathematical or typographical,) please let us know what and where so that it can be fixed. Currently, there is material for real and complex analysis, but there are still four other core sequences which would benefit from added resources here.

If you are code savvy, check out the Github repository. You can fork the repo and make edits directly. You may also request access to the repository if you are a current graduate student aiming to continue maintenance of the site.
